## FAQ
**Is this class free?**

Yes, totally free ü•≥.


**Do I need to have a Hugging Face account to follow the course?**

Yes, to push your custom models and pipelines to the hub, you need an account (it's free) ü§ó.

**What‚Äôs the format of the class?**

The course currently consists of at least **4 Units.** More will be added as time goes on, on topics like diffusion for audio. 

Each unit consists of some theory and background and one or more hands-on notebooks. Some also contain suggested projects and we'll have a competition for the best pipeline/demo (more details TDB).
