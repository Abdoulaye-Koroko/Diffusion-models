# Unit 1: An Introduction to Diffusion Models

Welcome to Unit 1 of the Hugging Face Diffusion Models Course! In this unit you will learn the basics of how diffusion 
models work and how to train your own using the diffusers library.

## Start this Unit :rocket:

Here are the steps for this unit:

- Make sure you've [signed up for this course](https://huggingface.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7f57e683fa28b51bfc493d048&id=ef963b4162) so that you can be notified when new units are released
- Read through the introductory material below and any linked resources that sound interesting
- Check out the [Introduction to Diffusers](#TODO) notebook to put theory into practice with the diffusers library
- Train and share your own diffusion model using the notebook or the [accompanying training script](#TODO)
- (Optional) Dive deeper with the [Diffusion Models from Scratch](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/blob/unit1/unit1/hfdmc_unit1_diffusion_models_from_scratch.ipynb) notebook 
([colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/blob/unit1/unit1/hfdmc_unit1_diffusion_models_from_scratch.ipynb))
if you're interested seeing a minimal from-scratch implementation and exploring the different design decisions involved
